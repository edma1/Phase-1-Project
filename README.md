# Phase-1-Project

This project aims to identify popular features of board games, such as complexity, play time, mechanics, domains, etc. Multiple visualizations are created to reflect these findings throughout the project. The overall goal is to give plausible recommendations for what features to include in a future board game to maximize its popularity and sales.

The dataset used in this project contains information about board games published on BoardGameGeek, including their names, user ratings, playtime, complexity, and mechanics. By analyzing this data, we can generate useful insights for board game enthusiasts, developers, and businesses involved in the board game industry.
